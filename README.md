## Pre-Training and Fine-Tune
1、 Download the pre-trained weights from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/cyinen/S4D), and move it to the [finetune/checkpoints/pretrain/voxceleb2+AffectNet] directory.

2、 Run the following command to pre-train or fine-tune the model on the target dataset.

```bash
# create the envs
conda create -n s4d python=3.9
conda activate s4d
pip install -r requirements.txt

# pre-train
cd pretrain/omnivision &&  OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 HYDRA_FULL_ERROR=1 python train_app_submitit.py +experiments=videomae/videomae_base_vox2_affectnet

# fine-tune
cd finetune && bash run.sh
```
